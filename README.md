## MY DATA SET
### The data set I chose is about COVID-19 and it shows confirmed worldwide cases, deaths and recoveries by countries during the pandemic. The data is in CVS format and it is sourced by CSSE (you can read more about it here: <a href="https://github.com/datasets/covid-19"> Click to know more </a>)
### The applications of this data set vary a lot as it can be useful for case and vaccination control, data visualization, machine learning, research projects, government policies or health analysts.

## MY BOOK
### I chose the book "R and Data Mining: Examples and Case Studies" by Yanchang Zhao. This book introduces readers into using R, which really interested me as I already began using this programming language back in my sophmore year and I really enjoyed working with it. Moreover, I wanted to continue using it for econometric purposes as my major is related to business and being able to visualize data, represent it and make financial analysis with it seems like a good knowledge to have for future applications.
