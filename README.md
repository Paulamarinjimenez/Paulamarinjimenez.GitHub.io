## MY DATA SET
### The data set I chose is about COVID-19 and it shows confirmed worldwide cases, deaths and recoveries by countries during the pandemic. The data is in CVS format and it is sourced by CSSE (you can read more about it here: <a href="https://github.com/datasets/covid-19"> Click to know more </a>)
### The applications of this data set vary a lot as it can be useful for case and vaccination control, data visualization, machine learning, research projects, government policies or health analysts.
